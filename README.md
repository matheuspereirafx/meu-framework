## ✨ Overview

**Ideaflow** is a specialized agent framework that guides you through the entire validation process of a business idea before you spend time and money on development.

The framework consists of chained agents where the output of one serves as the context for the next — forming a streamlined pipeline that moves from **ideation clarity** to a **comprehensive business plan**.

---

## 🔄 Full Workflow

The agents are designed to trigger in a specific sequence:

```text
/agente-ideia (Concept & Problem Root)
        ↓ [Auto-triggers]
/pesquisa-mercado (Market Research & Competitors)
        ↓ Generates: ideia.md + pesquisa-mercado.md
/agente-estrategia (Business Model & Positioning)
        ↓ Generates: estrategia.md
/agente-financeiro (Unit Economics & Projections)
        ↓ Generates: financeiro.md + financeiro.xlsx
/agente-mvp (Validation Strategy & Experiments)
        ↓ Generates: mvp.md
/skill-plano-negocio (Institutional Consolidation)
        ↓ Generates: executive-summary.md + business-plan.docx
```

## 🤖 Agents

### 🧠 `/agente-ideia` (The Concept)
The entry point of the pipeline. It transforms a raw idea into a validated root problem and an idealized solution.
* **Root Cause Analysis:** 5 Whys, Ishikawa (Fishbone) diagrams, and Job To Be Done (JTBD).
* **Pain Mapping:** Identifying the ideal intervention point.
* **Team Alignment:** Dao (Sun Tzu) principles and KSA (Knowledge, Skills, Abilities) gap mapping.

### 🔍 `/pesquisa-mercado` (Market Research)
Automatically triggered by the Idea Agent. It performs web research to structure market data.
* **Competitor Analysis:** Direct/Indirect competitors with real pricing and gap analysis.
* **Market Sizing:** TAM/SAM/SOM based on real market average ticket prices.
* **Persona:** Detailed profiles including digital behavior and current alternative solutions.

### 📈 `/agente-estrategia` (Strategy)
Builds the full positioning based on previous research.
* **Business Model Canvas:** 9 blocks with sourced information.
* **Blue Ocean (ERRC):** Eliminate, Reduce, Raise, and Create grid vs. competitors.
* **Revenue Model:** Justified pricing based on market benchmarks.

### 💰 `/agente-financeiro` (Financials)
Calculates complete financial viability based on one-by-one assumptions.
* **Unit Economics:** LTV, CAC, Payback, and Churn analysis.
* **Projections:** 24-month roadmap across 3 scenarios (Pessimistic, Realistic, Optimistic).
* **Automatic Alerts:** Triggers warnings if LTV/CAC ratio is unhealthy (< 3x).

### 🧪 `/agente-mvp` (Validation)
Defines the shortest path to validate high-risk hypotheses.
* **Risk Ranking:** Identifies 🔴 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low risk hypotheses.
* **Experiment Design:** Smoke tests, Concierge MVPs, Landing Pages, or Feature-light builds.
* **KPIs:** Retention, Conversion (Free to Paid), and NPS goals.

### 📄 `/skill-plano-negocio` (Business Plan)
Consolidates all outputs into institutional-grade documents (Markdown and Word).
